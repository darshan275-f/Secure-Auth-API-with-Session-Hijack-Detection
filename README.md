Developed a secure authentication system that only runs on the backend using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT. This system focuses on protecting sessions and building user trust. It tracks IP addresses and device fingerprints during login sessions and monitors for unusual activity. The system detects session hijacking attempts in real-time and sends automated email alerts to inform users of suspicious behavior. Implemented JWT access and refresh token rotation, which are secured with HTTP-only cookies. Designed custom middleware to validate sessions and enforce device consistency across requests. This approach ensures strong security and control in distributed environments.
