# üîê Secure Authentication API with Session Hijack Detection
Developed a secure, backend-only authentication system using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT, focused on advanced session protection and user trust. The system tracks IP addresses and device fingerprints during login sessions and actively monitors for anomalies. Session hijacking attempts are detected in real-time, triggering automated email alerts to notify users of suspicious activity. Implemented JWT access and refresh token rotation, secured via HTTP-only cookies. Designed custom middleware to validate sessions and enforce device consistency across requests, ensuring high levels of security and control in distributed environments.
